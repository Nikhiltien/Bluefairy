# Bluefairy

Bluefairy is a non UCI compliant chess engine written in Rust, developed with a unique approach. Instead of traditional board evaluation techniques, Bluefairy uses a combination of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to generate a "winning-chanes" score. The engine is not designed to search for the objective best move, but to emulate and exploit different human playing styles and patterns.
