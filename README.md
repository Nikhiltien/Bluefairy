# Bluefairy

Bluefairy is a chess engine written in Rust, developed with a unique approach (not UCI compliant). Instead of traditional board evaluation techniques, Bluefairy uses a combination of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to learn from sequences of human moves and predict blunders. The engine is not designed to search for the “objective” best move, but to emulate and exploit different human playing styles and patterns.
