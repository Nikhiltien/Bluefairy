# Bluefairy

Bluefairy is a non UCI compliant chess engine (a GUI is included), developed with a unique approach. Instead of using traditional reinforcement techniques with Minimax algorithms and self-play, Bluefairy uses a combination of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to generate a "winning chances" score from training on human games, puzzles, and human play. The engine is not designed to search for the objective best move, but to emulate and exploit different human playing styles and patterns.
